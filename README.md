# linux-stuff
A collection of my linux scripts and files

Installs Oh-My-Zsh, Roboto Mono Nerd Font, and some ZSH plugins.

Plugins: git, colored-man-pages, command-not-found, zsh-autosuggestions, zsh-syntax-highlighting, and zsh-history-substring-search

Install
Clone the repo, and run the include script, zshsetup.sh

If you are running a non-Ubuntu/Debian distribution you will need to manually install ZSH, if it is not already installed.
